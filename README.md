## Project 1: MAGIC-Gamma-Telescope-Classification

The objective is to classify Gamma and Hadron events using various machine learning algorithms and classifiers trained on the MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset.

- [Code](./MAGIC-Gamma-Telescope-Classification)
- [Dataset](./MAGIC-Gamma-Telescope-Classification/magic04.data)
- [Documentation](./MAGIC-Gamma-Telescope-Classification/README.md)

## Project 2: CIFAR10-small-images-classification

In this problem set we want to use PyTorch to train neural network-based image classifier. You will be using CIFAR-10 dataset to train and evaluate your model.

- [Code](./CIFAR10-small-images-classification)
<!-- - [Dataset](./CIFAR10-small-images-classification/data) -->

## Project 3: Face-Recognition-Using-PCA

A face recognition project using PCA.

- [Code](./Face-Recognition-Using-PCA)
- [Dataset](./Face-Recognition-Using-PCA/dataset/)
- [Documentation](./Face-Recognition-Using-PCA/README.md)
